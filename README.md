# TemplatePro - Productivity Application

TemplatePro is an application designed to help users manage templates with basic tagging and categorization. The user interface, built with [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), provides a starting point for organizing template data. 

> **NOTE:**  
> - The term "user-friendly" is used with a grain of salt — the app still needs some polishing.  
> - Tags and categories are **not customizable yet** (they are automatically added when a new template is created).  
> - Tags can be created but **cannot be removed**, and categories **cannot be removed** once added.  
> - "Productivity" is subjective and may vary depending on the user’s experience.  
> - [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) was used because it is a built-in module and doesn’t come with any licensing complications.

> **WARNING:**
> - The code in this project is currently in a spaghetti state. It may not adhere to best practices for organization and readability. Refactoring and improving the code structure are ongoing tasks to enhance maintainability and clarity.
> - Please review with care.
